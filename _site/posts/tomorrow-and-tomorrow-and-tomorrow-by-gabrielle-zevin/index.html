    <h1>Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow - Gabrielle Zevin</h1>
    <p>&quot;You're incredibly gifted, Sam. <strong>But it is worth noting that to be good at something is not quite the same as loving it.</strong>&quot; (Sam's adviser in the Mathematics Department, pg. 13)</p>
<p>&quot;To allow yourself to play with another person is no small risk. It means allowing yourself to be open, to be exposed, to be hurt. It is the human equivalent of the dog rolling on its back - I know you won't hurt me, even though you can. It is the dog putting its mouth around you hand and never biting down.&quot; (pg.26)</p>
<p>&quot;... the people who give you charity are never your friends. It is not possible to receive charity from a friend.&quot; (pg. 29)</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>they had that rare kind of friendship that allowed for a great deal of privacy within it</strong>. One of the reasons they has become such good friends originally was because she had not insisted he tell his sad stories to satisfy her own curiosity.&quot; (pg. 77)</p>
<p>&quot;One of Sam's eventual strengths as an artist and a businessman was that he knew the importance of drama, of setting the scene. ... he would want there to be a story about the day Sam Masur and Sadie Green had decided to work together.&quot; (pg. 79)</p>
<p>&quot;She could tell you exactly what was wrong with any game, but she didn't necessarily know how to make a great game herself. There is a time for any fledgling artist where one's taste exceeds one's abilities.&quot; (pg. 84)</p>
<p>&quot;If Marx at 22 had a problem, it was that he was attracted to too many things and people. Marx's favorite adjective was &quot;interesting&quot;. The world seemed filled with interesting books to read, interesting plays and movies to see, interesting games to play, interesting food to taste ...&quot; (pg. 113)</p>
<p>&quot;Long relationships might be richer, but relatively brief, relatively uncomplicated encounters with interesting people could be lovely as well. Every person you knew, every person you loved even, did not have to consume you for the time to be worthwhile.&quot; (pg. 230)</p>
