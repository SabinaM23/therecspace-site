    <h1>The Last Campfire</h1>
    <p>The Last Campfire is a little gem delivered by Hello Games. It tells the story of Ember, a lost soul trapped in a mysterious world filled with sorrow, hope, search for meaning and a way back home. The narrative revolves around uncovering the fate of other lost Embers and bringing them back to life by reigniting their inner campfires. The storytelling is supported by a soothing female narrator who adds warmth, guiding players like a trusted friend.</p>
<p>At its core, The Last Campfire is a puzzle adventure game. It has three main areas: the Forest, the Marsh, and the Caves. Ember must free a certain number of forlorn before advancing to the next location in the game. As the player frees the Embers, they gather around the central spot of each area - a campfire. Once the minimum limit is reached, the player can progress.</p>

<p>Visually, <em>the game</em> is stunning. Each area is distinct, with lush forests, desolate caves, and ethereal ruins creating a rich tapestry of environments. The use of color is particularly captivating, with warm tones evoking hope and cooler, shadowy ones emphasizing moments of despair. The sound design is equally impressive as the world feels tangible by like the crackling of a campfire, the rustling of leaves, or the echo of footsteps in cavernous spaces.</p>

<p>The puzzles are carefully crafted, with a smooth difficulty progression. Movable blocks, torch lighting, pressure plates make the puzzles enjoyable while rewarding creative problem-solving. More seasoned players may find some of them too light, as the primary focus is on the narrative and atmosphere.</p>

<p>Favorite quotes from the game:</p>
<p>‘Don’t you see? This is all there is. Just… the end. What hope can there be in that?’</p>
<p>‘When I reached this place, I could see the truth. This is all that there is. There is nothing that comes after. How do you face that? I’m not ready.’</p>
<p>‘I thought I was saving them. That they would lose hope if they knew. But without an end, they lost hope anyway…'</p>
<p>‘ I'm just... I don't wat to be helped.‘</p>
