<blockquote>
<p>The pursuit of an easier life led to a life full of hardships, and this did not happen for the last time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the few iron laws of history is that luxury goods tend to become necessities and create new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The imaginary order shapes our desires. Most people do not want to accept that the order governing their lives is imaginary, but in fact, each person is born into a preexisting imaginary order, and their desires are shaped from birth by its dominant myths.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no escape from the imaginary order. When we tear down the walls of our prison and run towards freedom, we are actually running into the larger courtyard of a bigger prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(...) Suffering arises from desire; the only way to completely free yourself from suffering is to completely free yourself from desire; and the only way to free yourself from desire is to train your mind to experience reality as it is.</p>
