    <h1>The Schopenhauer Cure - Irvin D. Yalom</h1>
    <p>“Life is something miserable. I have decided to spend mine thinking about that.”</p>
<p>“A person endowed with high and rare mental gifts, who is forced to accept a strictly utilitarian job, is like a precious vase decorated with the most wonderful images, but used as a kitchen pot.”</p>
<p>“Great suffering makes smaller ones impossible to feel, and, conversely, in the absence of great suffering, even the smallest worries and annoyances torment us.”</p>
<p>“A happy man is one who can avoid, once and for all, having to deal with the vast majority of his fellow humans.”</p>
<p>“If you do not want to be the toy of any scoundrel and the object of ridicule for any fool, the first rule is to be reserved and inaccessible.”</p>
<p>“We should treat any madness, failure, or human vice with indulgence, remembering that what we see before us are, simply, our own failures, madness, and vices.”</p>
<p>“Some cannot escape their own chains, yet they can still free their friends.”</p>
