“A win doesn't feel as good as a loss feels bad, and the good feeling doesn't last long as the bad. Not even close.”

"I wish I had some of my father's anger. I wish I could channel it during matches. I wonder what I could do in tennis if I could access that anger and direct it over the net. Instead, when my anger comes, I direct it at myself."
